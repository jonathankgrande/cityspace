# City Space

Overview: Thousands of homeless people often resort to sleeping in public spaces due to the lack of private residences available to them. As a result of this, they do not have a permanent storage space for personal belongings. With the development of this homeless/community website or app, we hope to provide the homeless community with a reliable storage area where they can safely set aside their valued possessions.
